# fss-0002

Featureless Settings Specification: 0003 - Extended List:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and whitespace to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  An open-brace ({) followed by any whitespace until a newline terminates a valid Object.
  Non-whitespace may not follow the open-brace of a valid Object.

  Content exists on every line following a valid object until the end of file (or string) or until a non-delimited close-brace (}).
  Any Content that could be interpreted as an end of content must be delimited if it should be part of the content.
  Whitespace may follow a valid close-brace but a terminating newline must be present to designate a valid end of content.

  There is no single-quote or double-quote delimitation in this specification.
  Only the open-brace that would result in a valid Object or the close-brace that would terminate valid Content can be delimited.
  Each delimit slash in an open-brace is treated as a potential delimit such that two slashes represents a single delimited slash ('\\\{' would represent '\{').
  Only the first delimit slash in a close-brace is treated as a potential delimit ('\\\}' would represent '\\}').

  Key\:
    \s = whitespace, except newline.
    \o = any printable character, except unescaped '{'.
    \l = any printable character or whitespace, except unescaped '}'.
    \c = either whitespace or printable, including newline, that is not interpretable as an Object.
    \n = newline.
    * = 0 or more occurrences.

  Structure\:
    \s*\o\l*{\s*\n\c*\n\s*}\s*\n

  Example\:
    # fss-0003
    # valid comments are ignored.
    "The Object" {
      Does not need to be quoted.
      This: does not need to be delimited.
      \}
    }
    Second {
      Continues until EOS/EOF.
      All whitespace, including newline (and leading whitespace) is part of content.
      # Valid comments are still ignored.
    }

  Objects would be\:
    1) "The Object"
    2) Second

  Contents would be\:
    1.1)  Does not need to be quoted.
          This: does not need to be delimited.
          }
    2.1)  Continues until EOS/EOF.
          All whitespace, including newline (and leading whitespace) is part of content.
