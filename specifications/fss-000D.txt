# fss-0002

Featureless Settings Specification: 000D - Iki Text:
  Iki is an unstructured WIKI-like syntax meant to be simpler than WIKI syntax.
  This fss specification represents a plain text file not following any special FSS structure but instead supports the IKI syntax.
  The IKI syntax may be used in any FSS specification and the specific vocabulary is defined by appending

  There is no requirement for any specific IKI vocabulary by this standard only that the given syntax is supported.
  To specify the IKI vocabulary being used append the IKI vocabulary header immediately after the fss header like such: "# fss-000d iki-0001".

  The IKI syntax provides a vocabulary name with specific context associated with it followed by quoted code that is represented by the given vocabulary name.

  When IKI is encapsulated inside any FSS format, the parent FSS format rules apply and must take precedence.
  Therefore additional escaping may be required.
  As for this FSS format (FSS-000D), there is no structure and therefore only the IKI syntax rules apply.

  For compatibility with the FSS terminology, the Vocabulary Name is to be considered the Object and the Vocabulary value is to be considered the Content.

  Key\:
    \o = any printable word character, including "_", "-", "+".
    \c = any printing character, including whitespace, and any delimited quote (used as the opening quote) or a any quote (undelimited) not used as the opening quote.
    \q = either a single quote (') or a double quote (").
    \x = any character.
    * = 0 or more occurrences.

  Structure\:
    \x*\o:\q\c\q

  Example\:
    # fss-000d iki-0000

    This is my sentence, anything can go here but sometimes I want to emphasis:"emphasize some text".

    Other times I want to render a url such as this example url: url:'http://www.example.com/url with space/'.

    There are no comments, except for maybe the FSS header.

    Quotes may be included, such as: code:"const char *string = \"My \\\"quoted\\\" C string.\";".

  Objects would be\:
    1) emphasis
    2) url
    3) code

  Contents would be\:
    1.1) emphasize some text
    2.1) http://www.example.com/url with space/
    3.1) const char *string = "My \"quoted\" C string.";
