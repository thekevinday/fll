# fss-0002

Featureless Settings Specification: 000D - Basic Rule:
  @todo: document this.
  This should be a special case that has an FSS Basic List on the outside and conditional types on the inside.
  The conditional types are context-specific and not defined by this specification.
  This specification only defines that they exist and not when/how they exist.
