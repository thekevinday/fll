# fss-0002

Featureless Settings Specification: 000D - Basic Rule:
  This is a special case that follows FSS-0002 (Basic List), and different FSS formats inside this Basic List.
  This Basic List is considered the "Outer List" and the Content of this Outer List is considered the "Inner Content".

  The Inner Content may be any of the following FSS formats: FSS-0000 (Basic), FSS-0001 (Extended), and FSS-0003 (Extended List).
  The way in which each format is determined is first to see if the Inner Content Object would be a valid Extended List Object.
  If the Inner Content Object is not a valid Extended List Object, then check to see if it is an Basic/Extended Object.

  The FSS Basic and FSS Extended Objects have the same format for Object names but the FSS Extended List Object is slightly different.
  Anything that would match an FSS Extended List Object must therefore be an FSS Extended List Object.

  Anything implementing this specification may impose its own restrictions on when to determine if the Inner Content is what FSS format, based on Object names.

  See the appropriate specifications for the Key/Structure/Example documentation for the respective FSS-0000 (Basic), FSS-0001 (Extended), and FSS-0003 (Extended List).

  Example\:

    main:
      name boot-devices

    script:
      start {
        ip addr add 127.0.0.1/8 label lo dev lo;
        ip link set lo up;
      }

      stop {
        ip link set lo down;
      }

    command:
      start mount -a -O no_netdev
      stop umount -arf -O no_netdev

  Outer List Objects would be\:
    1) main
    2) script
    3) command

  Outer List Contents would be\:
    1.1) name boot-devices

    2.1) start {
           ip addr add 127.0.0.1/8 label lo dev lo;
           ip link set lo up;
         }

         stop {
           ip link set lo down;
         }

    3.1) begin mount -a -O no_netdev
         end umount -arf -O no_netdev

  Inner Content Objects would be\:
    1.1.1) name
    2.1.1) start
    2.1.2) stop
    3.1.1) begin
    3.1.2) end

  Inner Content Contents would be\:
    1.1.1) boot-devices
    2.1.1) ip addr add 127.0.0.1/8 label lo dev lo;
           ip link set lo up;
    2.1.2) ip link set lo down;
    3.1.1) mount -a -O no_netdev
    3.1.2) umount -arf -O no_netdev
