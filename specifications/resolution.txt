Initial Draft - Currently Just Notes.

Need an alternative to /etc/resolv.conf.

Expand kevux specific practices that include "port" and "extension".
Add "scheme".

The "scheme" is a group or category in this case.
Consider "inet" for classic internet.

example resolution file (/etc/resolution):
  # fss-????
  inet:
    namesever 208.67.222.222
    extension kevux 127.0.0.2:123

  kevux:
    nameserver 127.0.0.2:123
    extension turtle 127.0.0.3:456


Can then do nslookup like this:
  nslookup google.com
  nslookup turtle.kevux
  nslookup kevux://google.com
  nslookup kevux://turtle.kevux
  nslookup kevux://kevin.turtle

Recommend reserving "http" and "https" for "inet" use in programs.

Need to include additional files that can be created dynamically.
Allow for user-specific checks.
Allow for custom cached includes.
Allow for custom use for things like VPN.
