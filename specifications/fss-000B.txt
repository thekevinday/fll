Featureless Settings Specification: 000B - Simple Json

TODO: this will be implemented such that it is as closely FSS compliant form of JSON.
It is not intended to be identical to JSON nor a JSON replacement.
It is intended to be a subset of JSON that follows the FSS practices.
(An FSS format that can be imported as JSON with no functional changes to the data).
This will likely be a more specific form of fss-0008 Embedded List, except additional tweaks added to accommodate JSON requirements.
