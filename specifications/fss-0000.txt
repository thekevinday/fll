# fss-0002

Featureless Settings Specification: 0000 - Basic:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and whitespace to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  Whitespace separates an Object from the Content.
  An Object may be followed by a newline, in which case means that the Object has no Content.

  Content exists on the same line as the Object.
  Content consists of everything following the first non-whitespace character until the newline.
  Content includes trailing whitespace before newline is reached.
  Content does not include the leading whitespace.
  No delimits are supported in the content.

  Key\:
    \s = whitespace, except newline.
    \b = either whitespace or printable, except newline.
    \q = non-whitespace or quoteded whitespace, no whitespace outside of quotes.
    \n = newline.
    * = 0 or more occurrences.
    + = one or more occurrences.

  Structure\:
    \s*\q+\s+\b*\n

  Example\:
    # fss-0000
