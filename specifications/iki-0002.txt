# fss-0002

IKI Specification: 0002 - Simple Script:
  This specification provides a small set of vocabulary names meant to be used for substitution in simple scripts.

  This specification only loosely defines the vocabulary context.
  Flexibility on interpretation is intended so that the context can be more fine-tuned for a given script design.

  Vocabulary\:
  - define: intended to be used for global properties, much like a C/C++ #define.
  - parameter: intended to be used for parameters or variables.

  See the iki.txt specification file for details on the syntax rules.
