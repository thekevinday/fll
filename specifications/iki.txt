IKI Specifications:
  IKI is an unstructured WIKI-like syntax meant to be simpler than WIKI syntax.

  The IKI syntax provides a vocabulary name with specific context associated with it followed by quoted code that is represented by the given vocabulary name.
  The vocabulary represents a list of allowed object names that may also have specific contextual meaning defined by a given IKI specification.

  The IKI format will use IKI-0000 to represent an IKI with no explicitly defined vocabulary.
  Whereas IKI-0001 and beyond represent a specific IKI vocabulary.

  Whitespace, non-word (and non "_", "-", "+") character punctuations, or the start of file must exist before any valid variable name.
  Whitespace and non-word (and non "_", "-", "+") character punctuations may not exist as part of the variable name.
  The only Unicode dash-like characters allowed as a "dash" are those intended to connect, such as the Unicode hyphens (U+2010 and U+2011).

  Unicode punctuation connector characters are supported just like "_", except when they connect outside the current line (such as U+FE33 "ï¸³").
  Unicode invisible punctuations (such as invisible plus: U+2064) are not considered a punctuations in this standard (because they a zero-width characters), therefore they are not to be considered a valid '_', '-', or '+' Unicode equivalents.

  Key\:
    \o = any printable word character, including "_", "-", "+" (and Unicode equivalents).
    \c = any character, including whitespace and non-printing, and any delimited quote (used as the opening quote) or a any quote (undelimited) not used as the opening quote.
    \q = either a single quote (') or a double quote (").
    \x = any character.
    \W = any non-word character, discluding "_", "-", "+" (and Unicode equivalents).
    * = 0 or more occurrences.
    ~ = one or more occurrences, or 0 if at start of file.

  Structure\:
    \x*\W~\o:\q\c\q

  Example\:
    # fss-000d iki-0000

    This is my sentence, anything can go here but sometimes I want to emphasis:"emphasize some text".

    Other times I want to render a url such as this example url: url:'http://www.example.com/url with space/'.

    There are no comments, except for maybe the FSS header (which would not resolve to any IKI syntax anyway).

    Quotes may be included, such as: code:"const char *string = \"My \\\"quoted\\\" C string.\";".

  Objects would be\:
    1) emphasis
    2) url
    3) code

  Contents would be\:
    1.1) emphasize some text
    2.1) http://www.example.com/url with space/
    3.1) const char *string = "My \"quoted\" C string.";
