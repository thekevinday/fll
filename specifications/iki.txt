IKI Specifications:
  IKI is a minimally structured WIKI-like syntax meant to be simpler than WIKI syntax.

  The IKI syntax provides a vocabulary name (with specific context associated with it) followed by quoted value that is associated with the given vocabulary name.
  The vocabulary represents a list of allowed variable names that may also have specific contextual meaning defined by a given IKI specification.
  The variable name is considered the italic:"Object" and is also considered the vocabulary.
  The variable value is considered the italic:"Content".
  The variable name may be wrapped by a single open bracket, character:"[" (unicode:"U+005B"), at the start and a single close bracket, character:"]" (unicode:"U+005D"), at the end.

  The wrapping characters characters are not part of the variable name and must not be contained within a variable name.
  The wrapping characters do not support escaping.
  Both wrapping characters must be specified or neither.

  The IKI format will use code:"iki-0000" to represent an IKI with no explicitly defined vocabulary.
  Whereas code:"iki-0001" and beyond represent a specific IKI vocabulary.

  A potential IKI variable name starts on word character or one of character:"_" (unicode:"U+005F"), character:"-" (unicode:"U+002D"), character:"+" (unicode:"U+002B"), character:"[" (unicode:"U+005B")).
  White space, non-word, and non character:"_" (unicode:"U+005F"), character:"-" (unicode:"U+002D"), character:"+" (unicode:"U+002B")) character punctuations may not exist as part of the variable name.
  The only Unicode dash-like characters allowed as a "dash" are those intended to connect, such as the Unicode hyphens (unicode:"U+2010" and unicode:"U+2011").

  Any potential IKI data must be escaped to make it treated as non-IKI data by prepending a backslash character:"\\" before the colon character:":" that is before the opening quote (single, double, or backtic). Potential IKI data refers to any valid IKI sequence without considering the closing single quote character:"'" (unicode:"U+0027"), closing double quote character:'"' (unicode:"U+0022"), or closing grave character:'`' (unicode:"U+0060").

  Unicode punctuation connector characters are supported just like character:"_", except when they connect outside the current line (such as unicode:"U+FE33" character:"ï¸³").
  Unicode invisible punctuations (such as invisible plus: unicode:"U+2064") are not considered a punctuations in this standard (because they a zero-width characters), therefore they are not to be considered a valid character:"_", character:"-", or character:"+" Unicode equivalents.

  Key\:
    code:"\o" = any printable word character, including character:"_", character:"-", character:"+" (and Unicode equivalents).
    code:"\c" = any character, including white space and non-printing, and any delimited quote (used as the opening quote) or a any quote (undelimited) not used as the opening quote.
    code:"\q" = either a single quote character:"'" (unicode:"U+0027"), a double quote character:'"' (unicode:"U+0022"), or a grave character:'`' (unicode:"U+0060").
    code:"\x" = any character.
    code:"\W" = any non-word character, discluding character:"_", character:"-", character:"+" (and Unicode equivalents).
    code:"\e" = an optional escape sequence of any number of backslashes, such as character:"\\".
    code:"[" = a single conditionally optional open bracket, character:"[" (unicode:"U+005B").
    code:"]" = a single conditionally optional close bracket, character:"]" (unicode:"U+005D").
    code:"*" = zero or more occurrences.
    code:"~" = one or more occurrences, or zero if at start of file.

  Before Structure\:
    code:"\x*\W~\*:*"

  Structure\:
    code:"[\o\e:]\q\c\q"

  After Structure\:
    code:""

  Example\:
    code\:'# fss-000c iki-0000

    This is my sentence, anything can go here but sometimes I want to italic\:"emphasize some text".

    Other times I want to render a url such as this example url: url\:'http://www.example.com/url with space/'.

    There are no comments, except for maybe the FSS\:"Featureless Settings Specification" header (which would not resolve to any IKI syntax anyway).

    Quotes may be included, such as: code\:"const char *string = \"My \\\"quoted\\\" C string.\";".

    The following italic\:"is escaped to not be treated as IKI data".'

    The conditionally optional open and close brackets allow for putting a variable directly next to another word character like: [context]\:"strong"this[context]\:"strong".

  Objects (also called vocabulary or variable name) would be\:
    1) FSS
    2) italic
    3) url
    4) code
    5) context
    6) context

  Contents (also called variable value) would be\:
    1.1) Featureless Settings Specification
    2.1) emphasize some text
    3.1) http://www.example.com/url with space/
    4.1) const char *string = "My \"quoted\" C string.";
    5.1) strong
    6.1) strong

  The following are core specifications (each with a common name associated with the specification number)\:
  - fss-0000: Unrestricted
  - fss-0001: Basic
  - fss-0002: Simple Script
