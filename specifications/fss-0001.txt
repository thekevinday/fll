Featureless Settings Specification: 0001 - Extended:
  Each Object starts at the beginning of a line and white space to the left of the Object is not treated as an object.
  White space separates an Object from the Content.
  An Object may be followed by a newline, in which case means that the Object has no Content.
  If only printing white space follows a valid Object, that Object is considered to have no Content.

  Content exists on the same line as the Object.
  Content is represented as multiple Content columns.
  Content columns are white space separated parts within the Content and terminated by a newline.
  Any number of Content columns may exist in the Content until the newline is reached.

  Key\:
    code:"\s" = White space, except newline.
    code:"\b" = Either white space or printable, except newline.
    code:"\q" = Non-white space or quoted white space, no white space outside of quotes.
    code:"\n" = Newline.
    code:"*" = Zero or more occurrences.
    code:"+" = One or more occurrences.
    code:"()*" = Grouping that repeats 0 or more times.
