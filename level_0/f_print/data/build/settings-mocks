# fss-0001
#
# Build the project with appropriate mocks linked in via the dynamic linker's "--wrap" functionality.
#
# The -Wl,--wrap does not work across shared files.
# Therefore, this file is a work-around to inject the mocks into the library for testing purposes.
# This should exactly match the "settings" file, except for the additional "-Wl,--wrap" parts and the additional mock source file.
#
# The flags -o0 must be passed to prevent the compiler from optimizing away any functions being mocked (which results in the mock not happening and a real function being called).
# Alternatively, figure out which optimization that is disabled by -o0 and have that specific optimization disabled.
