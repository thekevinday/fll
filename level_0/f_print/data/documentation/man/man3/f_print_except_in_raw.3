.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Similar to a c-library printf, except that this will only print a specific range.
.PP
An offset is provided because the except_at/except_in positions are expected to be relative to the start position, without the offset applied.
.PP
Will not stop at NULL. Will print NULL. Will not print any 1-byte character at a location specified in except_at array. Will not print any 1-byte character within the ranges specified in except_in array. Will print up to length 1-byte characters.
.PP
All UTF-8 characters, invalid or not, are printed as is.
.PP
This print function does not use locking, be sure something like flockfile() and funlockfile() are appropriately called.

.TP
.B stream
The file stream to output to, including standard streams such as stdout and stderr.

.SH RETURN VALUE
