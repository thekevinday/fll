.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Get a safe representation of the character if the character is considered unsafe.
.PP
Control characters are converted to the Unicode control character symbols, including NULL. UTF-8 sequences with a width of 1 are converted to the unknown character 'ï¿½'. For all other UTF-8 sequences, an empty string is returned.
.PP
The returned string will either be an empty string (for characters that are already safe) or a string representing the replacement. This can result in a 3-byte character being returned as a string of 3 1-bytes.
.PP
This should only be called for the first 1-byte character of a multibyte character.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B character
The character to verify as safe or not and then print.

.TP
.B width_max
This is set to the max number of bytes available. This is then updated to represent the max bytes used if enough space is available.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
A string with used length of 0 (an empty string) is returned if the character is already safe or is a UTF-8 character whose width is greater than 1. A string with a non-zero used length is returned if the character needs safe replacement. A string with a non-zero used length is returned are NULL terminated (after the used length).
