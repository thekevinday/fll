f_print_to_character_safely
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <to.h>
.sp
\fBf_status_t f_print_to_character_safely\fP(
    \fBconst f_char_t \fP\fIcharacter\fP,
    \fBconst int      \fP\fIid\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given a single 1-byte character, print the character or a replacement if the character is not considered safe.
.PP
Control characters are converted to the Unicode control character symbols, including NULL. UTF-8 sequences with invalid widths are converted to the unknown character 'ï¿½'. This can result in the 1-byte character being substituted with a 3-byte character when printing.
.PP
This should only be called for the first 1-byte character of a multibyte character.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B character
The character to verify as safe or not and then print.

.TP
.B id
The file descriptor to output to.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_none\fP on success.
.br
\fBF_data_not\fP if there is nothing to print.
.br
\fBF_block\fP (with error bit) if file descriptor is set to non-block and the write would result in a blocking operation.

\fBF_interrupt\fP (with error bit) if interrupt was received.
.br
\fBF_number_overflow\fP (with error bit) if maximum size reached while writing or attempting to write beyond maximum allowed offset.
.br
\fBF_parameter\fP (with error bit) if a parameter is invalid.
.br
\fBF_pipe\fP (with error bit) if a connected pipe or socket is closed.
