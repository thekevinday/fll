.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Identify whether or not a string explicitly represents a relative path string to the current working directory.
.PP
This does not check to see if the path exists or not. This does not stop on NULL (NULL characters are ignored).
.PP
A string that is explicitly relative to the current working directory must begin with one of "./" or "../".
.PP
This does not return true for paths that are implicitly relative, such as "abc".
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B path
The string that may or may not represent a relative path.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_true\fP if the string is a relative path string.
.br
\fBF_false\fP if the string is not a relative path string.
.br
\fBF_data_not\fP if the string has a length of 0 or the string is NULL.
