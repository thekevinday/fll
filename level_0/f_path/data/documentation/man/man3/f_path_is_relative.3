.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Identify whether or not a string represents a relative path string.
.PP
This does not check to see if the path exists or not. This does not stop on NULL (NULL characters are ignored).
.PP
A string without any path parts that could be a path is considered a relative path by this function. That is to say "my_file.txt" is a relative path string.
.PP
The strings that are relative to the current path, such as "./my_file.txt", are considered relative by this function.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B path
The string that may or may not represent a relative path.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_true\fP if the string is a relative path string.
.br
\fBF_false\fP if the string is not a relative path string.
.br
\fBF_data_not\fP if the string has a length of 0 or the string is NULL.
