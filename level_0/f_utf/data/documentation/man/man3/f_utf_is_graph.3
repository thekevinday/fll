.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <fll/level_0/utf.h>
.sp
\fBf_status_t f_utf_is_graph\fP(
    \fBconst f_string_t       \fP\fIsequence\fP,
    \fBconst f_array_length_t \fP\fIwidth_max\fP
);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Check to see if the entire byte block of the character is an ASCII or UTF-8 printable character.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B sequence
The byte sequence to validate as a character. There must be enough space allocated to compare against, as limited by width_max.

.TP
.B width_max
The maximum width available for checking. Can be anything greater than 0.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_true\fP if a UTF-8 graph.
.br
\fBF_false\fP if not a UTF-8 graph.
.br
\fBF_complete_not_utf\fP (with error bit set) if character is an incomplete UTF-8 sequence.
.br
\fBF_maybe\fP (with error bit) if this could be a graph but width is not long enough.
.br
\fBF_parameter\fP (with error bit) if a parameter is invalid.
.br
\fBF_utf_fragment\fP (with error bit) if character is a UTF-8 fragment.
.br
\fBF_utf_not\fP (with error bit) if Unicode is an invalid Unicode character.
