.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <fll/level_0/utf.h>
.sp
\fBf_status_t f_utf_is_fragment\fP(
    \fBconst f_string_t \fP\fIsequence\fP
);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Check to see if the entire byte block of the character is a 1-width UTF-8 character fragment.
.PP
Characters whose width is 1-byte are invalid. However, the character could have been cut-off, so whether or not this is actually valid should be determined by the caller.
.PP
For normal validation functions, try using f_utf_character_is() or f_utf_character_is_valid().
.PP
According to rfc3629, the valid octect sequences for UTF-8 are: UTF8-octets = *( UTF8-char ) UTF8-char = UTF8-1 / UTF8-2 / UTF8-3 / UTF8-4 UTF8-1 = x00-7F UTF8-2 = xC2-DF UTF8-tail UTF8-3 = xE0 xA0-BF UTF8-tail / xE1-EC 2( UTF8-tail ) / xED x80-9F UTF8-tail / xEE-EF 2( UTF8-tail ) UTF8-4 = xF0 x90-BF 2( UTF8-tail ) / xF1-F3 3( UTF8-tail ) / xF4 x80-8F 2( UTF8-tail ) UTF8-tail = x80-BF
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B sequence
The byte sequence to validate as a character. There must be enough space allocated to compare against, as limited by width_max.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_true\fP if a UTF-8 character.
.br
\fBF_false\fP if not a UTF-8 character.
