# fss-0000

_di_thread_support_ disables thread support, which is intended to disable this entire f_thread project. This is not directly used by this library, but is instead used by other libraries to not include f_thread (such as special compilations like monolithic). Future versions may potentially support this, providing stubs.
_pthread_attr_unsupported_ Disable non-portable functionality associated with pthread_attr.
_pthread_sigqueue_unsupported_ Disable GNU specific sigqueue().
