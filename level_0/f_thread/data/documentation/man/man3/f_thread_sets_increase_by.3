.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <fll/level_0/thread.h>
.sp
\fBf_status_t f_thread_sets_increase_by\fP(
    \fBconst f_array_length_t \fP\fIamount\fP,
    \fBf_thread_sets_t *const \fP\fIsets\fP
);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Resize the thread sets array to a larger size.
.PP
This will resize making the array larger based on the given length. If the given length is too large for the buffer, then attempt to set max buffer size (F_array_length_t_size_d). If already set to the maximum buffer size, then the resize will fail.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B amount
A positive number representing how much to increase the size by.

.TP
.B sets
The string sets array to resize.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_none\fP on success.
.br
\fBF_data_not\fP on success, but there is no reason to increase size (used + amount <= size).
.br
\fBF_array_too_large\fP (with error bit) if the new array length is too large.
.br
\fBF_memory_not\fP (with error bit) on out of memory.
.br
\fBF_parameter\fP (with error bit) if a parameter is invalid.
