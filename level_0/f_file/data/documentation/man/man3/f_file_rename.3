.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include <fll/level_0/file.h>
.sp
\fBf_status_t f_file_rename\fP(

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Rename a file.
.PP
The paths must not contain NULL except for the terminating NULL. The paths must be NULL terminated.
.PP
This essentially renames a file but can also change the file's path, which is identical to a move. However, renames only work within a file system and cannot be moved to another file system.
.PP
If destination already exists, then according to rename(), destination will be atomically replaced. Which, if destination is a directory, then that directory must either not exist or be empty.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B source
The path to the file to copy from.

.TP
.B destination
The path to copy to.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_none\fP on success.
