 * Defines all datatypes to be used for/by project fss.
 *
 * The purpose of compression is not to compression the entire file's contents but only and individual objects content, so the file is still partially readable.
 * NOTE: all start/stop locations must be defined as a (start < stop) and not (start <= stop), therefore if (start == stop) then stop.
 *
 * @todo identify all special UTF-8 characters that would violate the FSS design concepts, such as "Ogham space mark (áš€)" is not valid as whitespace in FSS because it is a visible non-whitespace character.
