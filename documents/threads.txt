Threads Documentation:
  With the inclusion of the f_thread project, the Featureless Linux Library supports and uses threads by default.
  This essentially adds -pthread to all level and monolithic builds with all projects depending on f_thread requiring passing -pthread.

  To compile without this thread support, remove all occurances of "-pthread" from each of the build settings files.
  Be sure to remove f_thread project from the compile list as well (which can be found either in the individual projects build settings file or the appropriate level or monolithic build settings file).

  Any project or library depending on f_thread must have -pthread passed to guarantee a correct and valid compilation.
