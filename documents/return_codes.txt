Implicit Return Types for f_status_t:
  When code:"f_status_t" is used as the return type, there are a common set of status codes that should always be expected as a possible return value.
  These are implicit expectations even if they are not explicitly documented.
  Any function that doesn't support these must document the exceptional state.

  code:"F_failure"\:
    This may be returned for any general error.
    This is often used as the failsafe error code so that an error code of some sort is always returned on error.

  code:"F_parameter"\:
    This is always potentially returned for any function whose parameter requires a validity checked.
    Much of this functionality can be optionally disabled, but the client using the API:"Application Programming Interface" need not be aware.

  code:"F_implemented_not"\:
    This is used to designate that the function or some part of the function is not supported.
    This is primarily used by individuals altering the project but maintaing API:"Application Programming Interface" compatibility.
    Any function must therefore support returning code:"F_implemented_not".

    There are some projects that can be enabled/disabled such as f_capability and f_threads.
    These should explicitly document returning code:"F_implemented_not".

Common Return Types for f_status_t:
  There are some code:"f_status_t" return types that are not required to be returned but are used quite often that they might seem required.

  code:"F_none"\:
    This general designates that no error occurred.
    This is a generic status code used all over the place.

  code:"F_memory_not"\:
    This general designates that the operation ran out of memory.
    This is a generic status code used all over the place.
