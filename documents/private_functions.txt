One of the objectives of this project is to make as much, if not all, of the functions available for use.

Another of the objectives is to design each function to operate in isolation to another function.
There is some flexibility in regards to this when it comes to individual projects.

Such a design has advantages and disadvantages.

One of those disadvantages is possible redundant code.
The c-programming language does not have private functions by any normal means.
The use of the f_gcc_attribute_visibility_internal helps simulate private functions.
Such functionality only works in supporting GCC compilers.

These synthetic private functions are implemented as an exception to the objectives for maintainability and redundancy purposes.
Such implementations should be kept to a bare minimum.

Functions defined as private will not be normally exposed through the public headers files.
Such functions will be prefixed with 'private_'.
