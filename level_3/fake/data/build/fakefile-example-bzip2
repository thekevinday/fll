# This is designed for bzip2-1.0.8 as an example for compiling bzip2.
#
# To use this example do the following:
#   1) download and extract bzip2-1.0.8.
#   2) change into the extracted bzip2-1.0.8 directory.
#   3) create the directory path "data/build/" within this bzip2-1.0.8 directory.
#   4) copy the files fakefile-example-bzip2, settings-example-bzip2, and settings-example-bzip2recover) into the created directory path "data/build/".
#   5) use the featureless make build operation to make, such as: "fake make -f fakefile-example-bzip2".
