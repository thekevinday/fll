# This is designed for the linux kernel source, probably some version of 5.x.
# This is intended to show that the functionality provided can go beyond the intended use, such as calling other build systems.
#
# This assumes make and everything necessary to compile the linux kernel is available.
#
# To use this example do the following:
#   1) download and extract the linux source, such as linux-5.8.8.
#   2) change into the extracted source (linux-5.8.8) directory.
#   3) run using this, such as: "fake make -f /path/to/fakefile-example-bzip2".
