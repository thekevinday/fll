# This is designed for compiling bzip2-1.0.8.
#
# To use this do the following:
#   1) Download and extract bzip2-1.0.8.
#   2) Change into the extracted bzip2-1.0.8 directory.
#   3) Create the directory path "data/build/" within this bzip2-1.0.8 directory.
#   4) Copy the files fakefile-bzip2, settings-bzip2, and settings-bzip2recover) into the created directory path "data/build/".
#   5) Use the featureless make build operation to make, such as: "fake make -f fakefile-bzip2".
