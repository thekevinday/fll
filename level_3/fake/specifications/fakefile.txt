# fss-0002

Fakefile Specification:
  The "fakefile" file follows the FSS-0005 (Somewhat Basic List) format with a sub-fomat of IKI-0002 (Simple Script).

  A fakefile is broken up into multiple Basic Lists, referred to as Sections, with two special purpose reserved Sections.
  The Sections are broken up into multiple Extended Objects and their respective Contents, referred to as Operations.

  Each of these non-reserved Sections acts as a set to perform some set of Operations.
  Each of these Operations perform a single command or action based on a set of reserved Operation types.
  Each of these Operations have a set of Arguments associated with them.

  How these Arguments are interpreted and processed are specific to each Operation type.
  The Operations are represented by the Extended Object name and the Extended Content represents the Operation Arguments.
  Each of these Operations support IKI variable substitution within their respective Arguments.
  The Operation Extended Object does not support IKI variable substitution.
  The reserved Settings Section does not support IKI variable substitution.

  The IKI-0002 vocabulary context is further clarified as follows\:
  - define\:
    The define object represents environment variables passed to the program or created by the program.
    The value represents the environment variable name and is case-sensitive.
    This IKI variable gets substituted with the environment variable's value or NULL if not defined.
    The "settings" list supports declaring custom environment variables (which overwrite any existing environment variable with the same name).

  - parameter\:
    The parameter object represents a variable that is to be substituted.
    The value represents the variable name and is case-sensitive.
    This IKI variable gets substituted with the value defined in the "settings" list or NULL if not defined.

  The reserved Section Objects are\:
  - settings: contains a list of Settings Objects and Content in FSS-0001 (Extended) format.
  - main: contains a list of Operation Objects and Content in FSS-0001 (Extended) format.

  The Settings Objects are\:
  - define: First Content represents variable name (case-sensitive), remaining Content represents varaiable value for IKI substitution.
  - fail: Only one Content, which must be either "exit", "warn" or "ignore" (quotes not required) (case-sensitive).
  - load_build: Only one Content, which must be either "yes" or "no" (quotes not required) (case-sensitive).
  - parameter: First Content represents variable name (case-sensitive), remaining Content represents varaiable value for IKI substitution.

  The build settings may also be specified in the Settings Section.

  The Operation Objects are\:
  - archive: One or more Content.
  - build: Zero or One Content. First Content represents path to the settings file, relative to the project root.
  - clean: Zero Content.
  - compile: One or more Content as parameters to compiler.
  - create: Two or three Content. First Content is either "file" or "directory" (case-sensitive), second Content is path to file, and third Content is "recursive" (case-sensitive) or is not provided.
  - define: Two or more Content.
  - delete: Two or three Content. First Content is either "file" or "directory" (case-sensitive), second Content is path to file, and third Content is "recursive" (case-sensitive) or is not provided.
  - else: Zero Content.
  - fail: One Content. First Content must be one of "exit", "warn", or "ignore" (case-sensitive).
  - group: Two or more Content. First Content is group name or number, remaining Content are paths to files.
  - groups: Two or more Content. First Content is group name or number, remaining Content are paths to files.
  - if: One or more Content. First Content is the condition, remaining Content are specific to the condition.
  - link: Two Content. First Content is the link target file and second Content is the pointer file (the link).
  - mode: Two or more Content. First Content is group name or number, remaining Content are paths to files.
  - modes: Two or more Content. First Content is group name or number, remaining Content are paths to files.
  - operate: One Content. First Content is the name of a valid Section Object, except for the reserved Section Objects.
  - owner: Two or more Content. First Content is group name or number, remaining Content are paths to files.
  - owners: Two or more Content. First Content is group name or number, remaining Content are paths to files.
  - pop: Zero Content.
  - print: Zero or more Content.
  - run: One or more Content. First Content is the name of the program (or script) and all remaining Content are passed as arguments to the named program (or script).
  - shell: One or more Content. First Content is the file path of the program (or script) and all remaining Content are passed as arguments to the named program (or script).
  - skeleton: Zero Content.
  - to: One Content. First Content is the directory path.
  - top: Zero Content.
  - touch: One Content. First Content is the file path.
