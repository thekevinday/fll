# fss-0002

Fakefile Specification:
  The "fakefile" file follows the FSS-0005 (Somewhat Basic List) format with a sub-fomat of IKI-0002 (Simple Script).

  The IKI-0002 vocabulary context is further clarified as follows\:
  - define\:
    The define object represents environment variables passed to the program or created by the program.
    The value represents the environment variable name and is case-sensitive.
    This IKI variable gets substituted with the environment variable's value or NULL if not defined.
    The "settings" list supports declaring custom environment variables (which overwrite any existing environment variable with the same name).

  - parameter\:
    The parameter object represents a variable that is to be substituted.
    The value represents the variable name and is case-sensitive.
    This IKI variable gets substituted with the value defined in the "settings" list or NULL if not defined.
