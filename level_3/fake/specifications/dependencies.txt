# fss-002

Dependencies Specification:
  The build settings "dependencies" file follows the FSS-0000 (Basic) format.

  Each Object represents a specific project name as it would be linked against.
  Each Content must not be specified, only FSS-0000 Object names are allowed.

  This file only holds dependencies provided by the FLL project.
  Order matters, and the provided order represents the order of dependencies.
  The first entry therefore has no preceding dependency and the last dependency could potentially depend on all dependencies above it.
