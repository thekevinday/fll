# fss-0002

Defines Specification:
  The build settings "defines" file follows the FSS-0000 (Basic) format.

  Each Object represents a specific a macro name to be defined during compilation.
  Each Content represents documentation explaining the intent and purpose of that define.

  The Object name has further restrictions than FSS-0000 requires.
  These restrictions are that the Object must only evaluate to a valid C/C++ macro name.
  This is essentially means only Word characters.
