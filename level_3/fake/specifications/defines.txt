# fss-0002

Defines Specification:
  The build settings "defines" file follows the FSS-0000 (Basic) format.

  Each Object represents a specific a macro name to be defined during compilation.
  Each Content represents documentation explaining the intent and purpose of that define.

  The Object name has further restrictions than FSS-0000 requires.
  These restrictions are that the Object must only evaluate to a valid C/C++ macro name.
  This is essentially means only Word characters.

  It is recommended that each define begin and end with an underscore.
  The Featureless Make program will convert the define as follows when compiling\:
    - Object name = "_en_my_macro_" will become "-D_en_my_macro_".
