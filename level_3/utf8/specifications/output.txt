# fss-0002

Output Specification:
  The following output to modes are supported\:
  - binary:    Print the binary character sequences.
  - codepoint: Print the Unicode codepoints.
  - combining: Print whether or not the character is a combining character.
  - width:     Print the width of the character.

Output to Binary:
  The output is printed as raw UTF-8 character sequences without any special formatting.
  May contain error data representing invalid characters (or codepoints).
  Invalid characters (or codepoints) may be designated as an error using a context, such as a color context of "error".
  All character codes, valid or not, may be printed as-is.
  May not be combined with any other 'Output to' modes.

Output to Codepoint:
  Only upper case ASCII characters 'U', '+', '0' through '9', and 'A' through 'F' are allowed.
  Always begins with 'U' and then '+'.
  Is always separated by a single space (ASCII character 0x20) (optionally except for the final codepoint in a set which may be terminated by a new line or the end of a file).
  May not contain non-ASCII values for designating characters (or codepoints) (which includes not allowing non-ASCII digits).
  May not be combined with any other 'Output to' modes.

Output to Combining:
  A single character is used to represent combining, not-combinging, or unknown.
  Is always separated by a single space (ASCII character 0x20) (optionally except for the final character in a set which may be terminated by a new line or the end of a file).
  The upper case ASCII character 'C' is used to represent a combining character.
  The upper case ASCII character 'N' is used to represent a non-combining character.
  The ASCII '?' is used to represent either an invalid or an unknown character.
  Invalid characters (or codepoints) may be designated as an error using a context, such as a color context of "error".
  May not contain non-ASCII values for designating characters (or codepoints) (which includes not allowing non-ASCII digits).
  May only be combined with 'Output to Width' mode.

Output to Width:
  A single character is used to represent width or unknown.
  Is always separated by a single space (ASCII character 0x20) (optionally except for the final character in a set which may be terminated by a new line or the end of a file).
  The ASCII character '0' is used to represent a 0-width character (generally this means a non-graph character).
  The ASCII character '1' is used to represent a 1-width character.
  The ASCII character '2' is used to represent a 2-width character.
  The ASCII '?' is used to represent either an invalid or an unknown character.
  Invalid characters (or codepoints) may be designated as an error using a context, such as a color context of "error".
  May not contain non-ASCII values for designating characters (or codepoints) (which includes not allowing non-ASCII digits).
  May only be combined with 'Output to Combining' mode.

Output to Combining and Width:
  When 'Output to Combining' is used with 'Output to Width', this operates exactly as 'Output to Width', except that when a valid combining character is detected, the ASCII 'C' character is used instead of the width.
