About utf8 Documentation:
  The utf8 program is intended to provide simple support for identifying UTF-8 character sequences with regard to its Unicode codepoint designation.
  Unicode codepoints may also be converted into their binary UTF-8 character sequence equivalents.

  Basic support for identifying and validating is provided.

  This is not intended to be an advanced UTF-8 processing program.
  While this is an open option for future development, it is beyond the scope, time, and knowledge of the author (Kevin Day).

  There is basic support for identifying character widths and combining characters.

Printing a Complete Binary String:
  The +q/++quiet must be used to suppress message output (this does not suppress output of processed data).

  The +n/++no_color must be used to suppress printing the color context that is used for invalid sequences.

  The -B/--to_binary must be used to print the binary string.

  The -F/--to_file may optionally be used (and is recommended to be used) to send the output to a file rather than to the screen.

  The -s/--strip_invalid must not be used as the binary string may contain invalid data that must be preserved for proper binary equivalence.

  The -S/--separate must not be used to ensure the data is not separated by multiple lines.

  The -H/--headers must not be used to ensure the processing headers are not printed.

  The -v/--verify must no be used as this suppressed data output.

  The -C/--to_codepoint must not be used as this prints Unicode codepoints rather than the binary string.
