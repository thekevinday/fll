_override_controller_default_program_script_ Provide a custom script name string to execute (such as php).
_override_controller_default_program_script_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_default_program_script_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_pid_ Use this as the default custom directory path representing the location of the controller program pid.
_override_controller_path_pid_init_ Provide a custom init path for the pid file rather than the default.
_override_controller_path_pid_init_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_pid_init_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_pid_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_pid_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_pid_prefix_ Use this as the default custom prefix prepended to the file name of the file representing the controller program pid.
_override_controller_path_pid_prefix_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_pid_prefix_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_pid_suffix_ Use this as the default custom prefix prepended to the file name of the file representing the controller program pid.
_override_controller_path_pid_suffix_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_pid_suffix_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_settings_init_ Provide a custom init path for the settings file rather than the default.
_override_controller_path_settings_init_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_settings_init_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_socket_ Use this as the default custom directory path representing the location of the controller program socket.

_override_controller_path_socket_init_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_socket_init_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_socket_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_socket_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_socket_prefix_ Use this as the default custom prefix prepended to the file name of the file representing the controller program socket.
_override_controller_path_socket_prefix_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_socket_prefix_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_override_controller_path_socket_suffix_ Use this as the default custom prefix prepended to the file name of the file representing the controller program socket.
_override_controller_path_socket_suffix_length_ The number of bytes representing the string in _override_controller_path_socket_suffix_ (not including the terminating NULL).
_pthread_attr_unsupported_ Disable non-portable functionality associated with pthread_attr.
