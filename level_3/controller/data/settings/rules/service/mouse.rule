  # @todo consider a new type, such as "variable" than can be used to get the variable and store it in an iki parseable variable.
  # This, however, may be too complicated than desirable (in terms of passing output back to the parent process).
  # such as:
  #variable device command fss_basic_read -can 0 device /etc/mouse
  #variable protocal script {
  #  fss_basic_read -can 0 device /etc/mouse
  #}
  #variable options set ""

  # @todo
  start gpm -m variable:"device" -t variable:"protocol" variable:"options"
