Time Documentation:
  The Controller program utilizes the unit of measurement called a "Time", represented with uppercase "T".
  For comparison, a unit of Time is equivalent to a nanosecond, or 10^-9 seconds.
  A MegaTime (MT) is therefore equivalent to a millisecond such that a millisecond is 10^-3 seconds.
  A unit of Time is intended to represent some unit of Time such that a single 64-bit integer may hold all units of Time for a single calendar year.
  This unit of Time does not and must not include Years (unlike Unixtime).
  To convert from Time to Unixtime, one must have a year (which could be assumed to be the current year) and then calculate all of those calendar oddities.
  A unit of Time by default is assumed to be in UTC.
  1 (Earth) year ~= 31536000000000000 Time or 31536000 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) day = 86400000000000 Time or 86400 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) hour = 3600000000000 Time or 3600 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) minute = 60000000000 Time or 60 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) second = 1000000000 Time or 1 GT (GigaTime).
  Consequentially, 1 day in units of Time is easily represented as 86.4 TT (TeraTime).
  The Time may be stored in its "year string format".
  In this format, a Year may be prepended to the Time followed by a single colon ':' to associate a year with the Time.
  This Year has no minimum or maximum but may not have decimals.
  For example, "2020:86400000000000" would represent: January 02, 2020 0:00 UTC.
  For example, "2020:86.4 TT" would represent: January 02, 2020 0:00 UTC.
