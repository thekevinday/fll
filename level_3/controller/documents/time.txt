Time Documentation:
  The Controller program utilizes the unit of measurement called a "Time", represented with uppercase "T".
  For comparison, a unit of Time is equivalent to a nanosecond, or 10^-9 seconds.
  A MegaTime (MT) is therefore equivalent to a millisecond such that a millisecond is 10^-3 seconds.

  A unit of Time is intended to represent some unit of Time such that a single 64-bit integer may hold all units of Time for a single calendar year.
  This unit of Time does not and must not include Years (unlike Unixtime).
  To convert from Time to Unixtime, one must have a year (which could be assumed to be the current year) and then calculate all of those calendar oddities.

  A unit of Time by default is assumed to be in UTC.
  1 (Earth) year ~= 31536000000000000 Time or 31536000 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) day = 86400000000000 Time or 86400 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) hour = 3600000000000 Time or 3600 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) minute = 60000000000 Time or 60 GT (GigaTime).
  1 (Earth) second = 1000000000 Time or 1 GT (GigaTime).

  Consequentially, 1 day in units of Time is easily represented as 86.4 TT (TeraTime).

  The Time may be stored in its "year string format".
  In this format, a Year may be prepended to the Time followed by a single colon ':' to associate a year with the Time.
  This Year has no minimum or maximum but may not have decimals.
  For example, "2020:86400000000000" would represent: January 02, 2020 0:00 UTC.
  For example, "2020:86.4 TT" would represent: January 02, 2020 0:00 UTC.

  A second unit of Time, called EpochTime, works the same way as Time except it represents seconds.
  This unit is designated "E".
  The format is similar to Time, except there are two colons: "1970::1620874738" would represent: May 13, 2021 2:58:58 UTC.
  When the year is not specified, then this is identical to UNIX Epoch.

  A unit of EpochTime by default is assumed to be in UTC.
  1 (Earth) year ~= 31536000 EpochTime or 31.536 GE (GigaEpochTime).
  1 (Earth) day = 86400 EpochTime
  1 (Earth) hour = 3600 EpochTime
  1 (Earth) minute = 60 EpochTime
  1 (Earth) second = 1 EpochTime
  1 GT (GigaTime) = 1 EpochTime

  Consequentially, 1 day in units of EpochTime is easily represented as 86.4 KE (KiloEpochTime).
