Packet Documentation:
  Describes how a packet is designed and intended to be used.

  The "packet" is the general category in which multiple types of packets belong.
  This describes the different packets based on their "type".

  Every packet contains a "header", a "type" within the header, a "length" within the header, and a "payload".

  The "controller" packet type\:
    Commands being sent to the controller and their respective responses utilize a "controller" packet.
    These are pre-defined commands to rules or the controller program itself.
    Commands such as starting or stopping some rule, for example.

    When operating in "init" mode, additional commands are available: "reboot" and "shutdown".
    The "reboot" is for rebooting the machine and will eventually support "kexec" mode.
    The "shutdown" is for shutting down the machine.
    These two commands are configurable to fire off based on conditions, namely "time".
    Two conditions may be met "on or after a specific date and time" and/or after so many milliseconds (second, minutes, hours, days, etc..) have passed.

    The normal "controller" packet commands are any valid Rule Action that performs some action.
    This does not include Actions that provide some setting or configuration (such as "with_pid").
    Some of the supported commands are: "freeze", "kill", "pause", "reload", "rerun", "restart", "resume", "start", "stop", or "thaw".

  The "error" packet type\:
    The error packet is intended to communicate some sort of failure.
    The "status" from the "header" designates the status code (based on the FSS status codes and FLL status codes).
    The "payload" will contain a NULL terminated string representin the message used to describe the error.
