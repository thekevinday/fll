  An Entry file name is expected to have the file extension ".entry".

  For each Entry file:
    - The outer most part is a FSS-0002 (Basic List).
    - The Basic List Object is considered the "Item".
    - The Basic List Content are considered the "Actions".
    - The "Actions" are FSS-0001 (Extended).
    - Each Action Object is the "Action Name".
    - Each Action Content are the "Action Parameters".

  The Items:
    - "main": required.

    - "command": optional.
       Any valid Object represents a command name with\:
         The first Content represents the file path (without any leading/trailing slashes and without file extension).
         The second Content represent the basename of the command file.
