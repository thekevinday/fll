# fss-0002

Entry Specification:
  The Entry files follow the FSS-0005 (Somewhat Basic List) format.

  An Entry file name is expected to have the file extension ".entry".

  For each Entry file:
    - The outer most part is a FSS-0002 (Basic List).
    - The Basic List Object is considered the "Item".
    - The Basic List Content are considered the "Actions".
    - The "Actions" are FSS-0001 (Extended).
