# fss-0002

Entry Specification:
  The "rule" files follow the FSS-0005 (Somewhat Basic List) format.

  An entry file name is expected to have the file extension ".entry".

  The outer most part, which is essentially FSS-0002 (Basic List), has the following Objects\:
    "main": required.

    The entry file may have any other valid Object, only the above have reserved uses.

    Inside each Basic List are essentially the following, FSS-0001 (Extended), Objects\:
      "category": One Content that is a valid Object name, except for the reserved "main".
      "controlled": One Content that is a valid Object name, except for the reserved "main".
      "failsafe": One Content that is a valid relative rule file name without the ".rule" extension.
      "only": Zero or more Content.
      "consider": One or more Content.
        The first Content that is the relative directory path (without any leading/trailing slashes).
        The second Content that is the basename for a rule file.

          - asynchronous
          - require
          - wait
      "rule": One or more Content.
        The first Content that is the relative directory path (without any leading/trailing slashes).
        The second Content that is the basename for a rule file.

          - asynchronous
