Entry Specification:
  The controller program communicates use the FSS-000E Packet format.

  Packet Structure\:
    Packet is grouped into the following blocks\:
      - control: A single 1-byte block representing contol codes.
      - size: A single 4-byte block representing the size of the entire packet, including the contol block.

  The "header" Object contains the following FSS-0001 Extended Objects (depending on "type")\:
    - action: A valid action type: "freeze", "kill", "pause", "reboot", "reload", "rerun", "restart", "resume", "shutdown", "start", "stop", or "thaw".
    - length: A positive whole number inclusively between 0 and 4294965248 representing the length of the "payload".
    - status: The status code name or number representing an FSS status code, such as F_none, F_failure, or 200 (where a number may have error and warning bits).
    - type: The packet type that is one of "error" and "controller".

  When there are multiple Objects of the same name inside the "header"\:
    - action: The order represents the order in which the actions are performed.
    - length: There may only be one length Object, all others after the first are ignored.
    - status: A status for each action, in the same order as the order of the action.
    - type: The first represent the type and all others represents a sub-type.

  There are different headers and payload properties based on the "type".

  The "error" type\:
    Supports the following headers: "length", "status", and "type".

    Currently only a single "status" is supported.

    The "payload" is a NULL terminated string whose length is defined by the "length" "header" Content.

  There are different headers and payload properties based on the "type".

  The "controller" type\:
    Supports the following headers: "action", "length", "status", and "type".

    Multiple "action" may be provided, but at least one must exist.
    Multiple "status" may be provided, but at least one must exist.

    The "payload" is dependent on the "action".
