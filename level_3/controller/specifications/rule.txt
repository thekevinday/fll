    "command": A Basic List of FSS-0001 (Extended) Object and Content, supporting the following Objects: "group", "restart", "reload", "start", "stop", and "user".
    "script": A Basic List of FSS-0003 (Extended List) Object and Content, supporting the following Objects: "restart", "reload", "start", and "stop" and A Basic List of FSS-0001 (Extended) Object and Content, supporting the following: "group" and "user".
    "service": A Basic List of FSS-0001 (Extended) Object and Content, supporting the following Objects: ""create", "group", "use", "restart", "reload", "start", "stop", "timeout", and "user".
    "settings": A (Required) Basic List of FSS-0001 (Extended) Object and Content, supporting the following Objects: "define", "environment", "name", "need", "pid", "want", "wish".

  For the above Basic List Objects, "main" may be specified only once whereas the others may be specifed multiple times.
