# fss-0002

Rule Specification:
  The Rule files follow the FSS-000D (Basic Rule) format with IKI-0000 (Unrestricted IKI).

  A Rule file name is expected to have the file extension ".rule".

  For each Rule file:
    - The outer most part is a FSS-0002 (Basic List).
    - The Basic List Object is considered the "Rule Type".
    - The Basic List Content is determined by the specific "Rule Type".
    - The Content for each "Rule Type" is called the "Item".
    - Each Item Object is the "Item Name".
    - Each Item Content is either the "Action" or the "Setting".
    - Each Action Object is the "Action Name".
    - Each Action Content are the "Action Parameters".
    - Each Setting Object is the "Setting Name".
    - Each Setting Content are the "Setting Values".

  The Rule Types\:
    "command": FSS-0003 (Extended List) or FSS-0001 (Extended).
    "script": FSS-0003 (Extended List) or FSS-0001 (Extended).
    "service": FSS-0003 (Extended List) or FSS-0001 (Extended).
    "settings": (Required) FSS-0001 (Extended).

  For the above Rule Types, "settings" may be specified only once whereas the others may be specifed multiple times.
  The "settings" Rule Type is always processed first, regardless of position.
  The other Rule Types are processed top-down.

  The "settings" Rule Type has the following FSS-0001 (Extended)\:

    "define": Two Content, the first Content must be a case-sensitive valid environment variable name (alpha-numeric or underscore, but no leading digits).
    "environment": Zero or more Content, each must be a case-sensitive valid environment variable name (alpha-numeric or underscore, but no leading digits).
    "name": One Content, must have at least 1 graph character (non-whitespace printing character) (leading and trailing whitespace are trimmed off).
    "need": Two Content, the first being a partial path and the second being a rule file name without extension (such as "boot" "modules").
    "parameter": Two Content, the first Content must be a case-sensitive valid IKI name and the second being an IKI value.
    "path": One Content representing a valid PATH environment string (such as "/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin").

    "stop": One or more Content representing a program being executed and its arguments.
    "use": One Content representing the path to a PID file.
    "user": One Content representing a user name or user id.

  The "command" and "script" Rule Types allow the following the FSS-0001 (Extended)\:
    "group": One Content representing a group name or group id.
