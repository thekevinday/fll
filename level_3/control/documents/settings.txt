Settings Documentation:
  This describes intent and purposes of the control settings file.

  The settings file provides default or system-wide settings.
  The system-wide settings file is loaded by default but a custom settings file may be alternatively specified.
  Using this avoids the need to add additional paramters to the command line when calling the control program.

  When this file is not specified any hardcoded defaults compiled into the program are used.

  The location of the settings file is compile time specific and should be changed depending on the particular design of the system.
  The default path for the control settings file is something like "/etc/control/settings".

  - name_socket\:
    This represents the file name used to construct the full socket path.
    The file name represents the name of the file but any file extensions, such as ".suffix", should likely use "path_socket_suffix" to specify the file extension.

    When not defined the compiled in default is used.
    The default socket path directory is generally "default" but this could be changed during compile time.

    This is required to not be empty so when the Object "path_socket" is defined without any Content, then an error is expected to be thrown.

    This is used along with the "path_socket", "path_socket_prefix", and the "path_socket_suffix" to construct the socket file.

  - path_socket\:
    This represents the directory path to the socket file provided by the controller or init service.
    This directory path is separate from the file name part so that the name can be more dynamically constructed without having to specify a full directory path each time.

    When not defined the compiled in default is used.
    The default socket path directory is generally "/var/run/controller" but this could be changed during compile time.

    When the Object "path_socket" is defined without any Content, then no path is added (resulting in the socket relative to the callers current working directory).

    This is used along with the "path_socket_prefix", the "path_socket_suffix", and the "name_socket" to construct the socket file.
    A full socket path might look something like "/var/run/controller/controller-default.socket".

    It is common for the controller program to be compiled as an init program.
    In this case it may be common for the full socket path to instead be something more like "/var/run/init/init-default.socket".

  - path_socket_prefix\:
    This represents a prefix used to construct the full socket path.
    This prefix is prepended to the socket file name.

    When not defined the compiled in default is used.
    The default path prefix is generally "controller-" but this could be changed during compile time.

    When the Object "path_socket_prefix" is defined without any Content, then no prefix is prepended.

    This is used along with the "path_socket", the "path_socket_suffix", and the "name_socket" to construct the socket file.

  - path_socket_suffix\:
    This represents a suffix used to construct the full socket path.
    This suffix is appended to the socket file name.

    When not defined the compiled in default is used.
    The default path suffix is generally ".socket" but this could be changed during compile time.

    When the Object "path_socket_suffix" is defined without any Content, then no suffix is appended.

    This is used along with the "path_socket", the "path_socket_prefix", and the "name_socket" to construct the socket file.
