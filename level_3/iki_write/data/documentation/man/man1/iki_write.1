.SH NAME
iki_write \- Convert text into an IKI format.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B iki_write
[\fI\,OPTIONS\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program will accept \fBObject\fR and \fBContent\fR strings to generate an IKI string, such as \fBobject:"content"\fR.
Each \fBObject\fR must have a \fBContent\fR (and each \fBContent\fR must have an \fBObject\fR).

The \fBObject\fR is also called the \fBVocabulary\fR.
A complete \fBObject\fR and \fBContent\fR set is also called a \fBVariable\fR.

When piping main to this program, a single form-feed character (\fB\\f\fR) (\fBU+000C\fR) must be used to separate each \fBObject\fR from each \fBContent\fR.
Furthermore, each \fBObject\fR must be followed by a \fBContent\fR.
