.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Increment buffer location until a non-graph character (including UTF-8) or an EOL is matched.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
.B buffer
The string to traverse.

.TP
.B placeholder
A single-width character representing a placeholder to ignore (may be NULL).

.TP
.B range
A range within the buffer representing the start and stop locations.

.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
\fBF_none\fP on success.
.br
\fBF_none_eol\fP on success, but stopped at EOL.
.br
\fBF_none_eos\fP on success, but stopped at end of buffer.
.br
\fBF_none_stop\fP on success, but stopped at end of range.
.br
\fBF_data_not\fP on success, but there was no string data to seek.
.br
\fBF_data_not_eos\fP on success, but the range.start >= buffer.used.
.br
\fBF_data_not_stop\fP on success, but the range.start > range.stop.
.br
\fBF_complete_not_utf\fP (with error bit) if character is an incomplete UTF-8 fragment.
.br
\fBF_complete_not_utf_stop\fP (with error bit) if the stop location is reached before the complete UTF-8 character can be processed.
.br
\fBF_complete_not_utf_eos\fP (with error bit) if the end of buffer is reached before the complete UTF-8 character can be processed.
.br
\fBF_memory_not\fP (with error bit) on out of memory.
.br
