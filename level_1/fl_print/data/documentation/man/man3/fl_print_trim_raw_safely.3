.SH DESCRIPTION

Print a string, stripping leading and trailing whitespace (and NULLs).

Control characters are converted to the Unicode control character symbols, excluding NULL. UTF-8 sequences with invalid widths are converted to the unknown character 'ï¿½'.
.PP
Will not stop at NULL. Will print NULL (that are not trimmed).
