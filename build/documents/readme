This package provides a _very_ primitive build system using a bash script called generate.sh.

The syntax for generate.sh is:
  generate.sh <command> [options]
  - where command is one of the following: 'build' or 'clean'.
  - No 'install' command is provided, all of the files to install may be found in the build/ directory after the build command is executed.
  - To install, simply copy the files in the build directory to their appropriate destination.

Build Example:
  ./generate.sh build

Install Example:
  cp -vR build/includes/* /usr/include/
  cp -vR build/libaries/* /usr/lib/
  cp -vR build/programs/* /usr/bin/
  cp -vR build/settings/* /etc/
  
If one of the build sub-directories, such as includes, libraries, programs, and settings, is empty or missing after a successfull build, then there are no files of that type to install.

Build Tree Structure Example (using the return_code-0.3.0 project):
  build/
  |-- includes
  |   `-- level_3
  |       `-- return_code.h
  |-- libraries
  |   |-- libreturn_code.so -> libreturn_code.so.0
  |   |-- libreturn_code.so.0 -> libreturn_code.so.0.3.0
  |   `-- libreturn_code.so.0.3.0
  |-- programs
  |   `-- return_code
  `-- settings
